Sort-Bucket
===========

Sort::Bucket is an XS module, implementing a bucket sort in string
lexical order for Perl arrays.  It can be much faster than Perl's
builtin sort function, if the data to be sorted is well suited to a
bucket sort.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install
